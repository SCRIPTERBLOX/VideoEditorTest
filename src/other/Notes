First i got code from Google AI -- 19 Mar

I decide to first try understand .png as it seems related (possibly not but I wouldnt that that yet) -- 19 Mar

Asked Google AI for a png reading thing that seems to output the image width height Color Type and bit depth correctly -- 19 Mar

After some thinking I belive i understand how we can figure out the positions for the pixels -- 19 Mar

So i thought this works by having the bytes by kinda like this [255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255 etc]
My approach would have mabey worked if the data was actually like that
